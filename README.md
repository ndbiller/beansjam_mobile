A downloadable game for Android

![**title screen**](/img/title.png "picture of the title screen")

An entry for the [Rocketbeans TV](https://www.rocketbeans.tv/) [BeansJam Mobile](https://itch.io/jam/beansjam) game jam 2018. Developed by [one person](https://ndbiller.github.io/portfolio/index.html) using mainly free software in 48 hours.

## DISCLAIMER:

**In it's current state please do not vote for this game in any form since there is almost no original content present so far.**
At the moment the game is still almost identical to the one offered [in the asset store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/2d-roguelike-29825) for free by Unity to help follow along with their [2D Roguelike tutorial](https://unity3d.com/de/learn/tutorials/s/2d-roguelike-tutorial). I will use the remaining time to individualise the game assets used for prototyping and will try to make something more original and Rocketbeans-related out of it.

## GAME:

**Story**: You are a travelling polka musician with a caravan of carnies. Your troupe arrives on the murky outskirts of New Orleans. Now you have to travel through the eerie swamps of the bayou to reach your final destination, looming gloomy in the distance. Can you escape the dangers of the swamp unscathed? Or will you succumb to the blues?

**Gameplay**: Fight against the cruel RNG gods of yesteryear and survive Permadeaths constant vicious attemts on claiming your hard-earned ever waning stash of rare eternal soul-stuff... like... in *that other game*. And all the stuff is randomly generated, for added replayability and more fun, the same way as in all those oldschool rouge-likes you so much enjoyed  when you were young. When playing as an *@* was still hip and training your little *d* to steal precious loot from those greedy shopkeepers for you was the bees knees (*Who's a good boy? Yes, you are! Yes! You! Are! Have this newt corpse as a treat... Yes! You git gud, Boy!*). Alas, nethack your way through hordes of bean-flavored foes and discover the true meaning of the blues. Completely captivating and hightly interactive, thanks to the innovative and slick state-of-the-art touch controls that your android device provides these days. And the highly original and captivating blues-and-polka-infused soundtrack extravaganza produced exclusively for this game by the hottest and most bestest public domain musicians I could find... Will. Rock. Your. World. 
Hard!

**Overwiew**: I will be Following some simple Unity tutorials, testing the 2D features of Unity (since I haven't been using Unity for quite some time now) while working with the included prototyping sprites from the tutorial available from the Unity asset store. Then I will switch them out along the way with some handmade pixel art and sprites inspired by the Rocketbeans guys and their work which I'll be creating in Aseprite. I'll add some more pictures telling a story, and thus working in the two required themes I have selected for this game from the three available ones: **Blues**, **Jahrmarkt** and **Dilemma**. Then I'll add some soundeffects and try to find a few polka-and-blues-inspired songs that complement the atmosphere and story of the project. In the end this will hopefully produce the 2D android rogue-like apk before the 48 hour timer hits zero. And finally, I'll try to document the necessary project steps and all the progress done here. Hopefully this'll show others how making games is fun and how this all can easily be be done by anyone if you just try.
